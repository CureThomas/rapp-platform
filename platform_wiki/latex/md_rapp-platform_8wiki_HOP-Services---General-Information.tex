Developed algorithms located under R\-A\-P\-P Improvement Center (R\-I\-C), can be utilized by robots via the R\-A\-P\-P Platform Web Services, exposed by R\-I\-C and furthermore the R\-A\-P\-P Platform. We consider R\-A\-P\-P Platform Web Services an imperative component of the R\-A\-P\-P Improvement Center (R\-I\-C) as they define the client-\/server interface layer.

H\-O\-P Web Services run under H\-O\-P Web Broker, as a part of R\-I\-C. Communication between remote clients and the H\-O\-P Server, and furthermore H\-O\-P Web Services, is achieved via {\bfseries H\-T\-T\-P Post requests}. H\-O\-P Web Server is exposed to the web via a public I\-Pv4 Address. Furthermore the H\-O\-P Web Services run on a specific system port and so those are accessible from remote clients via the H\-O\-P Web Server running I\-Pv4 Address followed by a port ({\bfseries xxx.\-xxx.\-xxx.\-xxx\-:8080}).

As H\-O\-P Web Services act as the interface layer between the Robot Platform and the Cloud Platform (along with the R\-A\-P\-P A\-P\-I), the development of those depends on both Client (User/\-Developer) and R\-I\-C requirements.

The communication workflow, from the client-\/side platform to R\-A\-P\-P Services can be severed into the following independent interface layers\-:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Client-\/side Platform -\/$>$ H\-O\-P Server.
\item H\-O\-P Server -\/$>$ H\-O\-P Web Services.
\item H\-O\-P Web Services -\/$>$ Rosbridge Web\-Socket Server.
\item Rosbridge Web\-Socket Server -\/$>$ R\-A\-P\-P Services (R\-O\-S Services).
\end{DoxyItemize}

The R\-A\-P\-P A\-P\-I, used from the client-\/side platform, integrates calls to the H\-O\-P Server and furthermore to the H\-O\-P Web Services. A H\-O\-P Web Service delegates service calls to the R\-A\-P\-P Services through the \href{https://github.com/RobotWebTools/rosbridge_suite}{\tt Rosbridge} interface layer.

Rosbridge Server provides a Web\-Socket transport layer to R\-O\-S and so it allows web clients to talk R\-O\-S using the rosbridge protocol. We use the Rosbridge Websocket Server in order to interfere with A\-I modules developed under R\-O\-S. That Web\-Socket server is not exposed to the public network and it is only accessible locally.

Furthermore, user authentication on Hop Web Services requests, is handled by Hop Web Server. Currently we use {\bfseries H\-T\-T\-P-\/\-Basic-\/\-Authentication} technique for enforcing access controls to the R\-A\-P\-P Platform web resources.

\subsection*{Initiate H\-O\-P Web Services}

For initiating H\-O\-P Web Server (and H\-O\-P Web Services), execute, under the $\ast$$\ast$$\ast$rapp-\/platform/rapp\-\_\-web\-\_\-services$\ast$$\ast$$\ast$ directory.

```shell \$ npm start ```

Every js file, stored under the services/ directory with a .service.\-js extension, is considered to be a H\-O\-P Web Service js executable file. H\-O\-P Server is responsible for registering those services, on run-\/time, as workers.
