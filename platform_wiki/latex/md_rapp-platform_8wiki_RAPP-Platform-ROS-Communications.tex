The {\ttfamily rapp\-\_\-platform\-\_\-ros\-\_\-communications} R\-O\-S package contains all the necessary R\-O\-S message, service and action files the R\-A\-P\-P Platform nodes require to operate. These are placed in the respoctive {\ttfamily msg}, {\ttfamily srv} and {\ttfamily action} folders. In these folders, each file is being kept under a dedicated folder for each R\-O\-S package.

This way, each R\-O\-S node has to declare the {\ttfamily rapp\-\_\-platform\-\_\-ros\-\_\-communications} as dependency, in order to use R\-O\-S messages, services or actions.
