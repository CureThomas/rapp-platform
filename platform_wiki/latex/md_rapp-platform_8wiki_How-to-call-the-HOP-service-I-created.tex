As previously stated \href{https://github.com/rapp-project/rapp-platform/wiki/How-to-write-the-API-for-a-HOP-service%3F}{\tt here} we support A\-P\-I(s) for\-:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Python
\item Java\-Script
\item C++
\end{DoxyItemize}

For simplicity, we will describe the procedure of calling a H\-O\-P Web Service using Python A\-P\-I calls.

We assume that you have previously read on \mbox{[}How-\/to-\/write-\/the-\/\-A\-P\-I-\/for-\/a-\/\-H\-O\-P-\/\-Service\mbox{]} and implemented the relevant A\-P\-I call for the H\-O\-P Web Service.

Calling a H\-O\-P Web Service is pretry much simple.

Import the Python R\-A\-P\-P-\/\-A\-P\-I module into your code and invoke the relevant A\-P\-I function.

```python from Rapp\-Cloud import Rapp\-Cloud

rapp\-Cloud = Rapp\-Cloud()

rapp\-Cloud.\-ontology\-\_\-subclasses\-\_\-of('Oven') ```

The above sample presents a call to the ontology\-\_\-subclasses\-\_\-of H\-O\-P Web Service.
