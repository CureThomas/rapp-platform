As previously stated \href{https://github.com/rapp-project/rapp-platform/wiki/How-to-write-the-API-for-a-HOP-service%3F}{\tt here} we provide and maintain A\-P\-I(s) for the following programming languages\-:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Python
\item Java\-Script
\item C++
\end{DoxyItemize}

For simplicity, we will describe the procedure of calling a H\-O\-P Web Service using the {\bfseries python rapp-\/platform-\/api}.

We assume that you have previously read on \href{https://github.com/rapp-project/rapp-platform/wiki/How-to-write-the-API-for-a-HOP-service%3F}{\tt How-\/to-\/write-\/the-\/\-A\-P\-I-\/for-\/a-\/\-H\-O\-P-\/\-Service} and implemented the respective Cloud Message class.

Usage of the Python implementation of the rapp-\/platform-\/api is also described \href{https://github.com/rapp-project/rapp-api/tree/master/python#calling-rapp-platform-services---api-usage}{\tt here}
