If you do not want to setup / install the R\-A\-P\-P Platform, or even use the ready-\/to-\/deploy ova file we provide, but you want to use some of its functionalities, you can do so by invoking the R\-A\-P\-P Platform services in our already deployed instance.

The I\-P address of this instance is {\ttfamily 155.\-207.\-19.\-229} and you can invoke any H\-O\-P service using the following url\-:

\begin{quotation}
155.\-207.\-19.\-229\-:9001/hop/\-H\-O\-P\-\_\-\-S\-R\-V\-\_\-\-N\-A\-M\-E

\end{quotation}


You can find the H\-O\-P service names \href{https://github.com/rapp-project/rapp-platform/wiki/RAPP-HOP-Web-services}{\tt here}.
