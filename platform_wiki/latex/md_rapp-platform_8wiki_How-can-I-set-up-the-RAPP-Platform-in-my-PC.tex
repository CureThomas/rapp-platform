The setup scripts are located in the \href{https://github.com/rapp-project/rapp-platform-scripts}{\tt rapp-\/platform-\/scripts} in the folder {\ttfamily /setup/}.

These scripts can be executed after a clean Ubuntu 14.\-04 installation, in order to install the appropriate packages and setup the environment.

\paragraph*{Step 0 -\/ Github installation}

Install git in order to be able to clone the repositories\-:

{\ttfamily sudo apt-\/get install git mercurial}

W\-A\-R\-N\-I\-N\-G\-: At least 10 G\-B's of free space are recommended.

\paragraph*{Install R\-A\-P\-P Platform}

It is advised to execute the clean\-\_\-install.\-sh script in a clean V\-M or clean system.

Performs\-:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item initial system updates
\item installs R\-O\-S Indigo
\item downloads all Github repositories needed
\item builds and install all repos (rapp\-\_\-platform, knowrob, rosjava)
\item downloads builds and installs depending libraries for Sphinx4
\item installs My\-S\-Q\-L
\item installs H\-O\-P
\item installs Caffe
\item installs the authentication system
\end{DoxyItemize}

\paragraph*{What you must do manually}

A new My\-S\-Q\-L user was created with username = {\ttfamily dummy\-User} and password = {\ttfamily change\-Me} and was granted all on Rapp\-Store D\-B. It is highly recommended that you change the password and the username of the user. The username and password are stored in the file located at /etc/db\-\_\-credentials. The file db\-\_\-credentials is used by the R\-A\-P\-P platform services, be sure to update it with the correct username and password. It's first line is the username and it's second line the password.

\paragraph*{Setup in an existing system}

If you want to add rapp-\/platform to an already existent system (Ubuntu 14.\-04) you should choose which setup scripts you need to execute. For example if you have My\-S\-Q\-L install you do not need to execute {\ttfamily 8\-\_\-mysql\-\_\-install.\-sh}.
