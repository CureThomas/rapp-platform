The R\-A\-P\-P Cognitive exercise system aims to provide the Robot users a means of performing basic cognitive exercises. The cognitive tests supported belong to three distinct categories, a) Arithmetic, b) Reasoning/\-Recall, c) Awareness. A number of subcategories exist within each category. Tests have been implemented for all subcategories in different variations and difficulty settings. The N\-A\-O robot is used in order to dictate the test questions to the user and record the answers. A user performance history is being kept in the ontology that aids in keeping track of the user’s cognitive test performance and in adjusting the difficulty of the tests he is presented with. Based on past performance the test difficulty adapts to the user’s specific needs in each test category separately in order to accurately reflect the user’s individual cognitive strengths and weaknesses. To preserve the user’s interest different tests are selected for each category using a least recently used model. To further enhance variation, even tests of the same subcategory exist in different variations.

\section*{R\-O\-S Services}

\subsection*{Test Selector}

This service was created in order to select the appropriate test for a user given its type. The service will load the user’s past performance from the ontology, determine the appropriate difficulty setting for the specific user and return the least recently used test of its type. In case no test type is provided then the least recently used test type category will be selected. By providing the test\-Type, test\-Sub\-Type, test\-Difficulty and test\-Index parameters, a test can be selected manually.

Service U\-R\-L\-: {\ttfamily /rapp/rapp\-\_\-cognitive\-\_\-exercise/cognitive\-\_\-exercise\-\_\-chooser}

Service type\-: ```bash \#the username of the user for which a cognitive test is requested string username \#used to specify the selected test type string test\-Type \#used to specify the selected test sub type string test\-Sub\-Type \#used to specify the selected test difficulty string test\-Difficulty \#used to specify the selected test index (id) \subsection*{string test\-Index }

string error \#tracen information string\mbox{[}\mbox{]} trace ```

\subsection*{Record User Performance}

This service was created in order to record the performance, meaning the score, of a user after completing a cognitive exercise test. The name of the test, its type and the user’s score are provided as input arguments. Within the service, a Unix timestamp is automatically generated. The timestamp reflects the time at which the test was performed. The service returns the name of the test performance entry that was created in the ontology.

Service U\-R\-L\-: {\ttfamily /rapp/rapp\-\_\-cognitive\-\_\-exercise/record\-\_\-user\-\_\-cognitive\-\_\-test\-\_\-performance}

string error \#tracen information string\mbox{[}\mbox{]} trace ```

\subsection*{Cognitive Test creator}

This service was created in order to create a cognitive test in the special xml format required and register it to the ontology. It accepts as an input a specially formatted text file containing all the information required for the test including its type, subtype, difficulty, questions, answers etc. The service formats the above information in an xml file and registers the test along with some vital information like it’s type and difficulty setting to the ontology. The service returns a bool variable that is true if xml creation and ontology registration were successful. Any possible error is contained in the error string variable also returned.

Service U\-R\-L\-: {\ttfamily /rapp/rapp\-\_\-cognitive\-\_\-exercise/cognitive\-\_\-test\-\_\-creator}

Service type\-: ```bash \#the path to the cognitive test file \subsection*{string input\-File }

\#true if service call was successful bool success \section*{possible error}

\subsection*{Return tests of type subtype and diffuclty}

This service will return the cognitive tests existing in the ontology for the given test\-Type, test\-Sub\-Type, difficulty and language. In case any arguments are not provided, it will be ignored, as such the query can be specific or general as needed.
