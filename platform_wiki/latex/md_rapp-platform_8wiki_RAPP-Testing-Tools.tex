Testing tools used for R\-A\-P\-P Platform integration tests.

The R\-A\-P\-P Testing Tools have been developed in consideration of providing to {\bfseries R\-A\-P\-P developers}, a system integration suite. While developing independent R\-I\-C modules, Web Services, Platform Agents, Robot Agents, the rapp\-\_\-testing\-\_\-tools package provides a way to test the functionality, system-\/wide.

All tests use the Python implementation of the R\-A\-P\-P Platform A\-P\-I,\href{https://github.com/rapp-project/rapp-api/tree/master/python}{\tt rapp-\/platform-\/api/python}, to request for .

A test, written under the R\-A\-P\-P testing tools framework, is composed of, at-\/least, the following ingredients\-:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The source code of the test class.
\item ({\bfseries Optional}) Data files used as a part of the test, if any are used. Data files can be, for example, image data files that will be transmitted to the R\-A\-P\-P Platform in order to perform image processing algorithms on those.
\end{DoxyItemize}

The implementation of a test is splitted into the following\-:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The R\-A\-P\-P Platform Service call(s).
\item The validation of the response.
\end{DoxyItemize}

Test classes inherit from Python unit testing framework, \href{https://docs.python.org/2.7/library/unittest.html}{\tt unittest}

At least one test, for each module located under the R\-A\-P\-P Improvement Center, has been developed. Integration test are used to check on the integration functionality, of the independent components which constitute the R\-A\-P\-P system. Those are developed in a way to also test the functionality of the interface layers between a client-\/side process and the R\-A\-P\-P Services.

\subsection*{Executing integration tests}

The rapp\-\_\-run\-\_\-test.\-py script is used in order to execute developed tests. This script accepts the following arguments passed by the cli\-:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \mbox{[} $\ast$$\ast$-\/i$\ast$$\ast$ \mbox{]} \-: Test filepath, to execute. If empty, all tests under the {\bfseries default\-\_\-tests} directory will be executed.
\end{DoxyItemize}

```bash \$ ./rapp\-\_\-run\-\_\-test\-\_\-.py -\/i default\-\_\-tests/face\-\_\-detection\-\_\-tests.\-py ```


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \mbox{[} $\ast$$\ast$-\/n$\ast$$\ast$ \mbox{]} \-: Number of times of test(s) execution.
\end{DoxyItemize}

```bash \$ ./rapp\-\_\-run\-\_\-test.py -\/i default\-\_\-tests/face\-\_\-detection\-\_\-tests.\-py -\/n 10 ```


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \mbox{[} $\ast$$\ast$-\/t$\ast$$\ast$ \mbox{]} \-: Run the test in threaded mode. Multible invocations can be done, simultaneous. Each test execution is handled by a single thread.
\end{DoxyItemize}

```bash \$ ./rapp\-\_\-run\-\_\-test.py -\/i default\-\_\-tests/face\-\_\-detection\-\_\-tests.\-py -\/n 10 -\/t ```

{\bfseries Note\-:} If no test\-\_\-name is provided as argument, all tests are executed!!

\subsection*{Developing integration tests}

A template\-\_\-test.\-py is located under the \href{https://github.com/rapp-project/rapp-platform/tree/master/rapp_testing_tools/scripts/default_tests}{\tt default\-\_\-tests} directory of the rapp\-\_\-testing\-\_\-tools package.

```bash \$ $<$path\-\_\-to\-\_\-rapp\-\_\-testing\-\_\-tools\-\_\-package$>$/scripts/default\-\_\-tests/ ```

Also, several tests have already been developed, located under the default\-\_\-tests directory. Those can be used as a reference/examples for developing new tests.

A Section in the \href{https://github.com/rapp-project/rapp-platform/wiki/How-to-implement-an-integration-test%3F}{\tt Wiki} exists that guides through developing integration tests for the R\-A\-P\-P Platform.
