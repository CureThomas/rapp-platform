Testing tools used for R\-A\-P\-P Platform integration tests.

The R\-A\-P\-P Testing Tools have been developed in consideration of providing to {\bfseries R\-A\-P\-P developers}, a system integration suite. While developing independent R\-I\-C modules, Web Services, Platform Agents, Robot Agents, the rapp\-\_\-testing\-\_\-tools package provides a way to test the functionality, system-\/wide.

All tests use the Rapp\-Cloud python module,\href{https://github.com/rapp-project/rapp-api/tree/master/python}{\tt python-\/rapp-\/api} to communicate with R\-A\-P\-P Platform A\-I modules.

A test, written under the R\-A\-P\-P testing tools framework, is composed of, at-\/least, the following ingredients\-:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The source code that describes the test (Python).
\item ({\bfseries Optional}) Data files used as a part of the test, if any are used. Data files can be, for example, image data files that will be transmitted to the R\-A\-P\-P Platform in order to perform image processing algorithms on those.
\end{DoxyItemize}

The implementation of a test defines two stages;


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The test execution.
\item The validation of the response.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\begin{quotation}
The developer, of the integration tests, is responsible to declare this set of valid results.

\end{quotation}

Using the R\-A\-P\-P testing framework, several tests have been developed. At least one test, for each module located under the R\-A\-P\-P Improvement Center, has been developed. Integration test are used to check on the integration functionality, of the independent components which constitute the R\-A\-P\-P system. Those are developed in a way to also test the functionality of the interface layers between a client-\/side process and the R\-A\-P\-P Services.

\subsection*{Executing integration tests}

The rapp\-\_\-run\-\_\-test.\-py script is used in order to execute developed tests.

\subparagraph*{Execution time arguments\-:}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \mbox{[} $\ast$$\ast$-\/i$\ast$$\ast$ \mbox{]} \-: Give as input, the test name, to execute.
\end{DoxyItemize}

```shell \$ ./rapp\-\_\-run\-\_\-test\-\_\-.py -\/i face\-\_\-detection\-\_\-test\-\_\-1.\-py ```


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \mbox{[} $\ast$$\ast$-\/n$\ast$$\ast$ \mbox{]} \-: Give number of execution of test(s).
\end{DoxyItemize}

```shell \$ ./rapp\-\_\-run\-\_\-test.py -\/i face\-\_\-detection\-\_\-test\-\_\-1.\-py -\/n 10 ```


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \mbox{[} $\ast$$\ast$-\/t$\ast$$\ast$ \mbox{]} \-: Run the test in threaded mode which means that multible invocations can be done, simultaneous. Each test execution is handled by a standalone thread.
\end{DoxyItemize}

```shell \$ ./rapp\-\_\-run\-\_\-test.py -\/i face\-\_\-detection\-\_\-test\-\_\-1.\-py -\/n 10 -\/t ```


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \mbox{[} $\ast$$\ast$-\/c$\ast$$\ast$ \mbox{]} \-: Test classes can be used to execute a spesific family of tests. Using test classes all tests, under this class, will be executed. In most cases a test class is named after the relevant R\-A\-P\-P Platform R\-O\-S-\/\-Package; \mbox{[} {\bfseries face-\/detection, qr-\/detection, speech-\/detection, speech-\/detection-\/sphinx4, speech-\/detection-\/google, ontology, cognitive, tts} \mbox{]}
\end{DoxyItemize}

```shell \$ ./rapp\-\_\-run\-\_\-test.py -\/i -\/c face-\/detection ```

{\bfseries Note\-:} If no test\-\_\-name is provided as argument, all tests located under tests paths are executed!!

There are two ways of executing developed tests\-:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Execute directly.
\item Execute under the R\-O\-S framework.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsubsection*{Using the python executable, directly}

The below example executes the qr\-\_\-detection\-\_\-test\-\_\-1, five times in sequential mode.

```shell \$ ./rapp\-\_\-run\-\_\-test.py -\/i qr\-\_\-detection\-\_\-test\-\_\-1.\-py -\/n 5 ```

\subsubsection*{Using R\-O\-S framework}

The below example executes all tests, once.

```shell \$ rosrun rapp\-\_\-testing\-\_\-tools rapp\-\_\-run\-\_\-test.\-py ```
