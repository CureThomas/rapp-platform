R\-A\-P\-P Platform is a collection of R\-O\-S nodes and back-\/end processes that aim to deliver ready-\/to-\/use generic services to robots. The main concept of R\-A\-P\-P Platform aligns with the cloud robotics approach.

As stated in \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_robotics}{\tt Wikipedia}\-:

R\-A\-P\-P Platform is divided in two main parts\-: the R\-O\-S nodes functionalities and the R\-A\-P\-P Web services. The R\-O\-S nodes are back-\/end processes the provide generic functionalities, such as Image processing, Audio processing, Speech-\/to-\/text and Text-\/to-\/speech, Ontology \& Database operations, as well as M\-L procedures.

The second part consists of the various web services, which are the front-\/end of the R\-A\-P\-P Platform. These expose specific R\-A\-P\-P Platform functionalities to the world, thus any robot can call specific algorithms, making easy the work of developers.
