The {\ttfamily rapp\-\_\-platform} folder is essentially the R\-A\-P\-P Platform metapackage, where all the R\-A\-P\-P Platform dependencies are declared. As stated in the \href{http://wiki.ros.org/Metapackages}{\tt R\-O\-S webpage}\-:

\begin{quotation}
Metapackages are specialized Packages in R\-O\-S (and catkin). They do not install files (other than their package.\-xml manifest) and they do not contain any tests, code, files, or other items usually found in packages.

\end{quotation}


\begin{quotation}
A metapackage is used in a similar fashion as virtual packages are used in the debian packaging world. A metapackage simply references one or more related packages which are loosely grouped together. \end{quotation}
