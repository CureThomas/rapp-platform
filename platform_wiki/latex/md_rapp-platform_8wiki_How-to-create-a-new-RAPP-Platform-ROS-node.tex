In order to create a new functionality in the R\-A\-P\-P Platform, usually a new R\-O\-S package needs to be created. Some general guidelines follow\-:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Rename the package to a specific name that shows what it does (beginning with {\ttfamily rapp\-\_\-}). Split in multiple packages if necessary.
\item Move the srv files in {\ttfamily rapp\-\_\-platform\-\_\-ros\-\_\-communications} (in a new subfolder) and declare the correct dependencies in the package's {\ttfamily C\-Make\-Lists.\-txt} and {\ttfamily package.\-xml}. Do not forget to give an intuitive name at your service
\item The R\-O\-S package should have the following folders and files\-:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily cfg}\-: Contains configuration files
\item {\ttfamily launch}\-: Contains the R\-O\-S package's launchers
\item {\ttfamily src}\-: Contains the source files (either C++ or Python)
\item {\ttfamily tests}\-: Contains the unit and functional tests (the folder's name {\bfseries must} be {\ttfamily tests}!)
\item {\ttfamily R\-E\-A\-D\-M\-E.\-md}\-: Contains the same information to the R\-A\-P\-P Platform wiki corresponding page
\item {\ttfamily setup.\-py}\-: If you have a python node this file should exist. Also a {\ttfamily \-\_\-\-\_\-init\-\_\-\-\_\-.\-py} file should exist in the {\ttfamily src} folder in order to create functional tests.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Rename the srv file and the service topic to comply with the rest of the platform
\item Rename the launch file to comply with the rest of the platform
\item Call the launch file from {\ttfamily rapp\-\_\-platform\-\_\-launch.\-launch} in the {\ttfamily rapp\-\_\-platform\-\_\-launchers} package, in order to be spawned with everything else
\item Add unit / functional tests
\item Add Doxygen documentation in your code
\item Add a description of your package here\-: \href{https://github.com/rapp-project/rapp-platform/wiki}{\tt https\-://github.\-com/rapp-\/project/rapp-\/platform/wiki}
\item Create a R\-E\-A\-D\-M\-E.\-md in the R\-O\-S package with the same information as in the wiki registration
